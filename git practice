git log ( this cmd is used to check when was the last commit done and by whom and with description)

git tag ( this cmd is used as book mark or check point which help users to understand current status of their coding)

git tag -a 'ver. no' -m "short comment" ( here -m flag is used to store shot comment along with tag name, for user refer)

git branch ( will give list of branch present)

git branch [branch name] ( to create new branch from current dir)
